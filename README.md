# Game Log
Game log is an web application built using NextJS, NextAuth, MongoDB React & TailwindCSS, as well as the RAWG API. I built game log to solve a problem I was having in my own life that I'm sure many have faced, "What game do I want to play?" I would set aside time at the end of a long day to sit down and play some video games, and would end up playing the same few games because I could never decide what game I wanted to play. I built this application to help remedy this problem!

# Usage

Search for any game you could think of and click the "Add Game" button on each game you would like to add to your lists. 

Then, navigating to the "My Games" page, you can utilize a Kanban board built with react-beautiful-dnd and drag/drop your added games into their respective categories.
